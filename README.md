My dot files, mainly git so far but working on more

## inspiration :couple:

Most of the inspiration for this has to go to Amanda Hill over at thoughtbot for tweeting about her dotfiles. Having already created my own alias and scripts files that I was saving to a google drive document making my own dotfiles only seemed smart.

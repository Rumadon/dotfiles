My dot files, mainly git so far but working on more

# dotfiles


## Inspiration

Most of the inspiration for this has to go to Amanda Hill over at thoughtbot for tweeting about her dotfiles. Having already created my own alias and script files that I was saving to a google drive document making my own dotfiles only seemed smart.

Received a lot of inspiration from Jarrod's install scripts for dotfiles.
